### Overview  
The Weather Data Interpolator tool is developed to interpolate daily gridded weather datasets from lower resolution to higher resolution using linear and inverse distance weighting method. The tool is developed using a free and open-source widget toolkit- PyQt available in Python. The source codes of the tool can be found at [Source Code](/Source%20Codes) folder which are feasible to modify/update in future for further improvement of used as well as the addition of new methodologies for better interpolation.  
  
### Installation  
The tool is easy to install in all the versions of Windows and does not require any supporting software for its installation. The installable executable file can be downloaded from [WDI v2.3.0](https://github.com/AgroClimaticTools/WDI/releases/download/v2.3.0/WDI.v2.3.exe).
